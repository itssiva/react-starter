This is my version of a react-starter kit.
Will update this doc specifying how each dependemcy is useful.


To start using this starter pack 

First, npm install
  npm installs all the required dependencies.

Then, enter the command, npm start
  Explanation: This version of the starter pack has webpack-dev-server as a dev-dependency. So, when we npm start, a light weight nodejs server is started, which listens for any changes in the files and sends a JS-diff to the fronend (via WebSockets).
